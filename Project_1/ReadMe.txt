Our codes is divided in different parts and they are quite different even if they do similar tasks, 
because they were developed by different people. Here there is a list of what codes were used to 
do the point of the exercise.
--- Point one - 1DHO
Errors on the wave functions: HO1DWaveFunct.cpp
Errors on the energy: HO1DEnergy.cpp
--- Point two - 3DHO
HO3DEnergy.cpp
--- Point seven 
CrossSectionLJ.cpp
